📦 Full Process to Upload a Module to PyPI
🔧 1. Prepare Your Project Structure
Example structure:

arduino



my_package/

├── my_package/

│   └── __init__.py

│   └── core.py

├── tests/

│   └── test_core.py

├── README.md

├── LICENSE

├── pyproject.toml

├── setup.cfg (optional)

├── MANIFEST.in (optional)

📝 2. Create pyproject.toml (Recommended Modern Approach)
pyproject.toml defines build system requirements.

toml


[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "your-package-name"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A short description"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.7"
license = {text = "MIT"}
authors = [{name="Your Name", email="you@example.com"}]
dependencies = ["requests"]  # Add your dependencies here

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo"
🛠️ 3. (Optional) setup.cfg and setup.py
If not using pyproject.toml fully, you can add a setup.cfg and/or setup.py. But for modern builds, setup.py is optional.

📁 4. Create a README.md
This is used for the PyPI description.

📃 5. (Optional) Add MANIFEST.in
Include files like README, license, etc.

makefile


include README.md
include LICENSE
🧪 6. Build the Package
Install build tools:




pip install build
Then build the package:




python -m build
This creates:

pgsql


dist/
├── your_package_name-0.1.0.tar.gz
└── your_package_name-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
🔐 7. Upload to PyPI using Twine
Install Twine:




pip install twine
Upload:




twine upload dist/*
It will prompt for your PyPI username and password. Or you can use an API token.

API Token Tip:

Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/

Create a token

Use it like:




twine upload -u __token__ -p <your-token> dist/*
🧪 Optional: Upload to Test PyPI First
Use Test PyPI to try out your upload before going live:




twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
Install from test PyPI:




pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package-name
✅ Verification
Once uploaded, you can:

See it live on: https://pypi.org/project/your-package-name/

Install it using:




pip install your-package-name
🚀 Pro Tips
Use bumpver or bump2version to manage versioning.

Automate build/upload with GitHub Actions.

Use setuptools_scm for automatic versioning from git tags.
